# J&T Express API Integration Guide

## Overview and Summary

Welcome to the J&T Express API Integration Guide. This document provides comprehensive information on integrating with J&T Express APIs to enhance your business operations. From placing orders to tracking shipments and tariff checking, this guide covers all aspects of API integration with J&T Express.

## Function and Implementation Planning

### Functions of J&T Express APIs

1. **Basic Order API**: Place orders from marketplaces or ecommerce platforms to J&T Express.
2. **Tracking API**: Track shipment progress and status in real-time.
3. **Tariff Checking API**: Check shipping rates from origin city to destination district.
4. **API Cancel Order**: Cancel orders that have not been processed by J&T Express.

### Implementation Planning

1. **Start**: Fill Information Form and select required APIs.
2. **Cooperation Agreement**: Establish an agreement between Client and J&T Agent.
3. **Test API Integration**: Integrate test/sandbox APIs and perform testing on J&T testing environment.
4. **Mapping Process**: Map client's data with J&T's list of districts, cities, and provinces if required.
5. **Production API Integration**: Use production key and endpoint for final testing.
6. **Finish**: Complete all steps and ensure the API is connected to the J&T platform.

## Usage Cases
### 1. E-commerce Order Fulfillment Automation
**Scenario:** An online marketplace wants to automatically create shipping orders with J&T Express whenever customers place purchases.

- When a customer completes checkout on the e-commerce platform, the system automatically sends a **Basic Order API** request to J&T with shipping details.
- J&T returns an Air Waybill (AWB) number via API.
- The platform displays the AWB number to the customer for tracking purposes.
- The system tracks the shipment status using the **Tracking API** to update customers in real-time.
- If the customer cancels the order before shipment, the platform uses the **API Cancel Order**.
This use case automates order processing, reduces manual entry, and improves customer service.

### 2. Real-time Shipment Tracking for Customer Support
**Scenario:** A customer service team needs instant access to the latest shipment status when handling inquiries.
- Customer support queries the **Tracking API** using the AWB to fetch real-time package location and status.
- They respond accurately to customers about estimated delivery times or delays.
- Automated alerts can be set up based on tracking status updates received from J&T APIs.
This use case improves support efficiency and customer satisfaction by providing up-to-date information.

### 3. Shipping Rate Estimation for Checkout
**Scenario:** An online store wants to display accurate shipping costs to customers before order submission.
- At checkout, the platform sends an origin and destination city/district to the **Tariff Checking API**.
- Receives shipping rates and estimated delivery times.
- Displays available shipping service options and costs in the UI.
- The customer selects a shipping service based on rates/ETD provided by J&T.
This use case enhances the checkout experience with transparent shipping costs and options.

### 4. Order Cancellation Before Shipment
**Scenario:** A merchant needs to cancel an order that has been placed via the API but not yet processed by J&T.
- The merchant calls the **API Cancel Order** passing the order ID.
- J&T confirms whether cancellation was successful or if the order has already progressed beyond cancelable status.
- The merchant updates the order status accordingly in their system.
This use case provides flexibility for merchants to manage shipments and customer expectations.

## Sequence diagram

The sequence diagram you provided outlines the flow of interactions in a typical J&T Express API integration scenario between a User (Customer), an E-commerce platform (Ecom), and J&T Express (JNT). Hereâ€™s an explanation of each step:

1. **User - Customer Order -> Ecom**  
   The customer places an order on the e-commerce platform. This triggers the process of preparing the order for shipment.

2. **Ecom - Ecom Request API -> JNT**  
   The e-commerce platform sends an API request to J&T Express to create a shipment order. This request typically includes shipment details such as sender and receiver information, package details, and service type.

3. **JNT - Return AWB Number -> Ecom**  
   J&T Express processes the order request and responds by returning an Air Waybill (AWB) number. The AWB number is a unique tracking code that identifies the shipment.

4. **Ecom - Return AWB Number -> User**  
   The e-commerce platform receives the AWB number from J&T and sends it back to the customer. This allows the customer to track their shipment using the AWB.

5. **User - Drop Off -> JNT**  
   Finally, the customer drops off the package at a J&T service point or arranges for pickup, handing over the physical shipment to J&T Express for delivery.
